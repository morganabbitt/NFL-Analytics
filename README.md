# NFL Advanced Analytics on 4th down 

The game of Football is ever changing and is constantly adapting to new technology and advances in science. But is every aspect of the game advancing? Inspired by Brian Burke's reasearch article "4th Down Study" written in 2014, I have chosen to reintroduce his findings about 4th down decision making and advanced football analytics. Using the combination of Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, I aim to change the stigma around "risky" decision making specifically on 4th downs. 

We are constantly in awe of the changes made to the medical technology side of the game, why does this science have to be any different?

## 1. Overview

Need a quick refresher? Check out this [video...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t6hM5tRlfA).

As someone that loves football and loves math, I always find myself in a predicament when my teams are faced with 4th downs. 
This study will provide insight about 4th downs and the subsequent play calls that follow. 
show that due to the expected point outcomes (that will be explained later) teams should always 'go for it' on 4th and 1. But why don't they?

## 2. Goals

**Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, this study predicts deicion making on 4th down and provides insight into what the outcomes could be if coaching tatics were adjusted.**

My long term goals: 
I want to use the research and analyses I have done to revolutionalize sports using Big Data. As a woman and a data scientist, I love bringing my skills and my passions to this male dominanted industry. So much more needs to be done and we will never know the advances we can make unless we do work similar to this study.

## 3. Data

Thanks to Maksim Horowitz, Ron Yurko, and Sam Ventura, this data is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016). 
From the 2009 to the 2018 regular season, this dataset contains 449,371 rows (individual plays) and 255 columns (features). 

|Entire Dataset | 4th Down Plays|
|-----------------------------|--------|
| 449371 individual plays     | 39644 plays|
| 10 seasons                  | 10 seasons |
| 2526 unique games           |2526 unique games |
