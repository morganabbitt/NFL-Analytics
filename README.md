# NFL-Analytics

The game of Football is ever changing and is constantly adapting to new technology and advances in science. But is every aspect of the game advancing? Inspired by Brian Burke's reasearch article "4th Down Study" written in 2014, I have chosen to reintroduce his findings about 4th down decision making and advanced football analytics. Using the combination of Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning, I aim to change the stigma around "risky" decision making specifically on 4th downs. 

We are constantly in awe of the changes made to the medical technology side of the game, why does this science have to be any different?
